Vanilla JS on steroids

I have always been a big fan of Vanilla JS (Native JS) and find its austerity the most elegent feature. Despite numerous number of Javascript frameworks already available, my aim behind writing this library is to power pack the native JS with all those features which any developer uses on a day to day basis removing the dependency of any such framework or libraries and it is native so need for learning any new syntax.

## Features:
- Available throughout the JS environment
- No need for learning any new syntax (forget all the '$s' and '_s')
- Can be used with any other framework (no need for dependency injection or importing required)
- Simple and Elegent
- Can be used with Node JS (server side) and on Browser as well.


## New Plug and Play Geolocation Library:

- Forget the hassels of obtaining the Geo Coordinates from browser we have handled that just call our API and play with the coordinates.

We are in a very rudimentary stage and would love to hear from you. Please contact for any bug, functionality and suggestions.
